Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that has been implemented in Python programming language. The game starts by choosing a random word from a pre-defined list of words. The player has to guess the word by suggesting letters one by one.

For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn on the screen, representing the progress of the hanging. The player loses the game if the stick figure is fully drawn before they guess the word correctly. The player wins if they guess the word correctly before the stick figure is completed.
